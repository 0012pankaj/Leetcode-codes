//Approch :
//.To bring h1 and h2 at same distance from null we use this short approch and best approch
//1.we itrate h1 and h2 upto which we get h1==h2 
// when any of h1,h2 reaches null we put them at starting of other lit; (if h1 is at nul of list1 we put it on list2 starting samw with h2
//at some time we get them moving parllel with same distance from null and when the got same value we return any of them
//HELP FROM TUF*

// many people do lenthy code 
by first find difference of list and start bla bla bla ..given on gfg is long approch
